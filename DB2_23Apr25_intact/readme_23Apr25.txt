The previously received databases, particularly measurements, had a simple filter of removing all values of BMI <= 25 removed, getting rid of valuable measurement points about the latter half of some patients' treatments, too. 
This database contains all measurements, and I have to get rid of all initial values of patients who started treatment with a BMI under 25. 

This database also contains all relevant date variables regarding Genomics.

It was received with the following message: 
- Se ha quitado la restricción de IMC <=25
- También he añadido los campos de fechas de Genomics en la prescripción, que en el último que te pasé no los tenína.
