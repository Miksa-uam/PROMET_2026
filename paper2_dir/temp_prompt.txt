I want to get the most out of Kiro, as the specification-driven development is a cool idea that could bring a lot of opportunity to my workflow. 

However I need to trust this system and understand its limitations to be able to adapt it. 

The experience with the FDR implementation is lukewarm. 
The workflow seemed smooth, specifications were relevant, but the implementation was crazy. 
How is it that the most important specs were not implemented? 
- there was no fdr correction option in the notebook
- when manually adding it, it was not recognized
- and when finally making that fix, the fdr corrected p value column did not appear in the output

We did a lot of refactoring, we changed the whole directory structure. 
With all of that, Kiro seemed pretty intelligent and useful. 
But these errors are still serious. 

Without changing any code or anything, can you just do a bit of reflection on this project, tell me what went wrong, what are the limitations of Kiro in this context, and how can I make sure to bring the most out of this promising tool?
