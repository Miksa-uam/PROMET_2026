FIXED /prescriptions:
all columns are mixed up, basically
tomas totales column contains person names

patients: 
number of patients with genomics sample IDs do not correspond to the number of Yes options in the column Genomics_available:
1427 'Available' with 2836 sample IDs in patients, and 2711 in alleles
1918 have a sample ID but 'available' is set to No
509 with 'available: yes' have no sample IDs
only 918 patients have 'available: yes' AND a sample ID

alleles: 
commented in patients, otherwise OK

medical records: 
looks OK, although some age values are big outliers, 100+ (while still within the normal distribution)

measurements: 
looks OK, although some VAT values are big outliers (while still having a more or less normal distribution)
