create a data frame that is built by a code that takes and conjoins certain specific columns of data frames created so far.
before loading the pulled columns from the source data frames, they need to pass 3 steps of formatting: they need to be sorted in ascending order AND they need to be renamed in a way that represents the source data frame (as specified below) AND any duplicates must be collapsed. 

i want the code to pull the following columns from the following data frames in the following format: 

from patients_standard pull: patient_id, genomics_sample_id renamed as patient_id_from_patients, genomics_sample_id_from_patients
from prescription_standard pull: patient_id, prescription_id, medical_record_id renamed as patient_id_from_prescription, prescription_id_from_prescription, medical_record_id_from_prescription
from medical_record_standard pull: medical_record_id renamed as medical_record_id_from_medical_record
from measurements_standard pull: patient_id renamed as patient_id_from_measurements
from alleles_standard pull: patient_id, genomics_sample_id renamed as patient_id_from_alleles, genomics_sample_id_from_alleles

please remember to sort the values in ascending order AND collapse any duplicates.
